# Developing RESTful Web Services and Microservices with Java and Spring Boot

Welcome to my journey through the Udemy course **"Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud"**. This repository documents my progress and key takeaways from the course. This is not a teaching guide, but a showcase of my learning experience.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into four main parts:

1. **RESTful Web Services**
2. **Microservices**
3. **Docker**
4. **Kubernetes**

Each section builds on the previous one, starting with the basics of RESTful web services and progressing to the orchestration of microservices using Kubernetes.

### Part 1: RESTful Web Services

In this section, I learned the fundamentals of developing RESTful web services using Java and Spring Boot. Key topics covered include:

- **Developing Resources for a Social Media Application**: Implementing RESTful endpoints.
- **Versioning**: Managing different versions of APIs.
- **Exception Handling**: Implementing global exception handling.
- **Documentation with Swagger**: Auto-generating API documentation.
- **Basic Authentication**: Using Spring Security for authentication.
- **Filtering and HATEOAS**: Implementing filtering of data and hypermedia as the engine of application state.

#### Tools and Technologies

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java applications.
- **Spring MVC (Spring REST)**: Framework for building RESTful web services.
- **Spring Security**: Framework for securing Spring applications.
- **Swagger**: Tool for API documentation.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool.
- **Eclipse**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- **Postman**: API client for testing REST services.
- **Tomcat Embedded Web Server**: Server for running the application.

### Part 2: Microservices

This part covers the basics of microservices architecture and how to implement microservices using Spring Cloud.

- **Inter-Microservice Communication**: Techniques for communication between microservices.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic among microservices.
- **Scaling Microservices**: Techniques for scaling services up and down.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Using Spring Cloud Config Server for centralized configuration.
- **Eureka Naming Server**: Service discovery and registration.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Using Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin for tracing requests across microservices.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implementing fault-tolerant services with Zipkin.

### Part 3: Docker

In this part, I learned the basics of Docker and how to containerize microservices.

- **Building Docker Containers**: Creating Docker images for microservices.
- **Docker Basics**: Understanding Docker architecture and commands.

### Part 4: Kubernetes

The final part covers Kubernetes, a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.

- **Kubernetes Basics**: Understanding Kubernetes architecture and concepts.
- **Orchestrating Microservices**: Using Kubernetes to manage microservices.
